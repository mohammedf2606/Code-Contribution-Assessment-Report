Measuring code contributions in student-led group projects is essential to rank the contributors fairly and fairly distribute the marks depending on these contributions. Analysis into previous work showed there is a clear discrepancy between different approaches to code contribution decision systems and their capacity for accurate user ranking. This project attempts to improve on these current decision systems and seeks to be language agnostic and aware of code quality. The algorithm tracks contributions for each user through the number of characters they are attributed in the target repository and ranks each of these characters based on how many succeeding commits that these characters survived for. It also has the ability to tracks line movement between commits and accredits changes in characters to the user who made them.
